(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- updating string after call back function
- adding picture inside switch button

Haven’t done list:
1. Ugly layout for some activities (fixed part of them, don’t know if there are more)
2. User preferences
   two ways to achieve this:
       -randomly select one recipe, then pass it to SimilarRecipe Request <-- do this first, later change
       -increase chance for different type of food, and generate a recipefilter to combine with the user defined recipe filter

Problems:
1. BASICALLY API THINGS!!!!!!

Challenge:
1. Timer in recipes <— could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
2. Notification for the app <- might require me to use server/another api
3. Animation for liking and disliking

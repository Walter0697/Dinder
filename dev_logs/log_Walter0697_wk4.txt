I asked TA about our app (for 30-60mins?)
I think I should make some changes for the interface

Changes included:
1. Changing the favourite screen to calendar. The reason is "liked list" and "saved list" is kinda similar for now
2. Setting up something like "missing ingredients" so the app will show the recipe even tho you don't have enough ingredients
3. Setting up timer to make the user more easier to calculate the time when cooking

Challenges:
1. Using Picasso SDK to get the image from the internet but it didnâ€™t work quite well (about 1 week, still working on it)
2. App cannot run in some phone because of the sdk version (need API 24)

Finished:
1. Setting up expandable list view, working for ingredient list right now
2. Finish the basic of the calendar (still buggy)

(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- nothing yet

Haven’t done list:
1. Ugly layout for some activities (fixed part of them, don’t know if there are more)
2. “Missing ingredients” features (Really depends on the api)
3. User preferences
   two ways to achieve this:
       -randomly select one recipe, then pass it to SimilarRecipe Request <-- do this first, later change
       -increase chance for different type of food, and generate a recipefilter to combine with the user defined recipe filter
4. Continue working on url generate
       -how to implement search feature???????
       -take a look at the complex url

Problems:
1. Complex request seems to have too long time to run
2. Search and filter should be different to make main function more random

Challenge:
1. Timer in recipes <— could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
2. Notification for the app <- might require me to use server/another api
3. Animation for liking and disliking

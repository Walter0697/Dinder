(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- figure out the issue about cropping the image
- setting the callback function for the image, should work fine now
- splash screen
- user can define their own ingredients now
- fixing recipe filter (now it can generate a request link for random ingredients)
- created a user preferences class lol
- url generator
  -> random url with selected tag (ingredients)
- setting alpha when dragging!!!!

Haven’t done list:
1. Ugly layout for some activities (fixed part of them, don’t know if there are more)
2. “Missing ingredients” features
3. User preferences
   two ways to achieve this:
       -randomly select one recipe, then pass it to SimilarRecipe Request <-- do this first, later change
       -increase chance for different type of food, and generate a recipefilter to combine with the user defined recipe filter
4. Continue working on url generate

Challenge:
1. Timer in recipes <— could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
2. Notification for the app <- might require me to use server/another api
3. Can we set up a server for data-centric style?
4. Animation for liking and disliking

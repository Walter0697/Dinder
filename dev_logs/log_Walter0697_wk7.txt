(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- figure out the issue about cropping the image

Haven’t done list:
1. Ugly layout for some activities (not sure if any left)
2. Timer in recipes <— could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
3. “Missing ingredients” features
4. I think the picture loading is still buggy whenever we have new picture, weird but it is about the library
5. Animation for liking and disliking instead of just disappearing 
6. If possible setting the aplha of the picture when dragging
7. Starting/loading screen
8. Notification for the app

(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- figure out the issue about cropping the image
- setting the callback function for the image, should work fine now
- splash screen
- user can define their own ingredients now
- fixing recipe filter (now it can generate a request link for random ingredients)
- created a user preferences class lol

Haven’t done list:
1. Ugly layout for some activities (not sure if any left)
2. “Missing ingredients” features
3. Animation for liking and disliking instead of just disappearing 
4. If possible, setting the aplha of the picture when dragging
5. User preferences
   two ways to achieve this:
       -randomly select one recipe, then pass it to SimilarRecipe Request
       -increase chance for different type of food, and generate a recipefilter to combine with the user defined recipe filter
6. Setup class to convert list to url

Challenge:
1. Timer in recipes <— could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
2. Notification for the app <- might require me to use server/another api
3. Can we set up a server for data-centric style?

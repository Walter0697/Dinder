(4 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- working on the callback function, api, I think I got an idea about how to work with the api, should be fine later
- set up so that whenever it saved inside our calendar, will also save it inside google calendar
- buggy but implemented search screen
- upload the app into play store (beta)

want to do list:
1. API not always give what i want, so i should do some checks about it

Challenge:
1. Timer in recipes <â€” could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
2. Animation for liking and disliking

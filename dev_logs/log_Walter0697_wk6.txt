(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- Changing most of the icons in the app, making special features like, have color only when it is on click, making some mystery feature~~~
- library should work perfectly fine right now
- making the drag shader opaque non-0 so that it will be like dragging when user drag it
- adding border to the image so that every images will be the same size
- setting shared preference for most of the information
- I created an icon!!!!
- setting up min and max for filter

About the API:
Some image url is weird, without https://www for random recipe search 
Best way to do is -> get recipe id for the random/similar search
Then use “get Recipe Information”
If want for ingredient -> “get Food information”

Haven’t done list:
1. Buggy calendar
2. Ugly layout for some activities (some information can’t be shown)
3. Timer in recipes <— could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
4. “Missing ingredients” features
5. Cropped circle will have black background, not sure about the Paint and Canvas library

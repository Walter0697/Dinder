(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- Changing most of the icons in the app, making special features like, have color only when it is on click
- changing some codes with the library so that it seems like it won’t have the result of the onPrepareLoad()
- making the drag shader opaque non-0 so that it will be like dragging when user drag it

Haven’t done list:
1. Buggy calendar
2. Ugly layout for some activities (some information can’t be shown)
3. Timer in recipes
4. “Missing ingredients” features
5. Adding border in the picture
6. Adding shared Preference so the app will save user information

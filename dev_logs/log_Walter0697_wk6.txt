(5 hours per days in average)

Finished List:
- Changing most of the icons in the app, making special features like, have color only when it is on click, making some mystery feature~~~
- library should work perfectly fine right now
- making the drag shader opaque non-0 so that it will be like dragging when user drag it
- adding border to the image so that every images will be the same size
- setting shared preference for most of the information
- I created an icon!!!!
- setting up min and max for filter
- fixing bug in calendar view (now it should work perfectly)
- fixing some layout issues

About the API:
Some image url is weird, without https://www for random recipe search 
Best way to do is -> get recipe id for the random/similar search
Then use “get Recipe Information”
If want for ingredient -> “get Food information”

Haven’t done list:
1. Ugly layout for some activities (not sure if any left)
2. Timer in recipes <— could be difficult because it will duel with another widget type
3. “Missing ingredients” features
4. Cropped circle will have black background, not sure about the Paint and Canvas library
5. I think the picture loading is still buggy whenever we have new picture, weird but it is about the library

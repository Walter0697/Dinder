I setup the basic user interface with the knowledge from the tutorials

I am trying to make some fancy function so I didn't follow the coding that people do in the tutorials
I modify it and try to code things by my own

These are some that I successfully implemented:
1. double drawer (both left and right)
2. bottom bar with big button in the center
3. changing image size according to the screen width (haven't tried on the other device so can't be sure about the effect)

Here is the things that I am going to achieve:
1. Cropping the image into circle and add the border on it
2. expending the drawer header and get rid of the menu so that functionality doesn't have to be restricted by menu item
3. Setting up class for filter and food information

Here is the things that I may do when I finish most function:
1. Making the dragging image not transparent
2. Setting alpha of the image according to their position
